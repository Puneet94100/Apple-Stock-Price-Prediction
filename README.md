#  APPLE Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This project aims to predict the stock price of Apple using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that are specifically designed to handle sequential data, making them well-suited for time series analysis.



## Data 
The data set used in this project consists of daily closing prices for Apple's stock over a period of 2018 - 2022. The data is obtained from publicly available sources and is preprocessed


# Modeling approach
The LSTM model is trained on the closing price data and uses past prices to predict future prices. The model is trained using a sliding window approach, where the input data consists of a fixed number of previous closing prices and the target data is the next closing price. The model is trained using a combination of mean squared error loss and the Adam optimization algorithm.




## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using a split of the data into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data using metrics such as mean squared error and mean absolute error.
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of LSTM networks for stock price prediction. While the results obtained in this project are by no means a guarantee of future performance, they do provide a strong foundation for further research and development in the field.
